// Hello World : 
console.log("Hello World")  
console.log('Aditya Thakur')
console.log('I Love Apple I - Phone')//basic understanding how we write small line code in js

// Variable : 

Naturalname = 'theadicoder';//simple string
age = 16;//Integer
price =' 100 $ ';//string var
X = null;//null
Y = undefined;// undefined
radius = 14;// Integer
isFollow = true;// Boolean
console.log(Naturalname,age,price,X,Y);//run all over code here

// Javascript Was Dynamically Typed Language which mean we can change the one or two line code value on run time and then we can't do it on another langugaes .

// we can't write any variables name staring from a no. because for its an integer but also we can write it in string and alphabatic form.

// eg - we can writing staring with  _, string, a-b..

// eg - what we can't do in any
